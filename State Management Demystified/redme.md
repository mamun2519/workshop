# Unidirectional State Management

## What is a Unidirectional State?

Unidirectional state means that data flows in one direction, following a predictable pattern. In React and other state management libraries like Redux, Zustand.

This concept ensures that changes in state always follow a clear, structured path.

### How Does Unidirectional State Work?

**Data Flows Down**

- The state is stored in a single source of truth (like Redux store, Zustand store).
- This state is passed down to child components.

**Actions Trigger State Updates**

- A user interacts with the UI (e.g., clicking a button).
- The event dispatches an action (like Redux dispatch).
- The state updates and the changes flow back down to the UI.
