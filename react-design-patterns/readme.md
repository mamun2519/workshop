# React Design Pattern

## Container Presentation Pattern

The Container-Presentation Pattern is a design pattern in React that separates UI components (Presentation Components) from logic and data-fetching components (Container Components).

Importance of Container Presentation Pattern:

Separation of Concerns – It keeps UI components clean and focused only on rendering while keeping data-fetching and business logic separate.
Reusability – The same presentation component can be reused with different data sources.
Easier Maintenance – Changes in logic don’t affect the UI and vice versa.
Better Testing – You can test UI separately from business logic.
