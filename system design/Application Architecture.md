## Application Architecture

- Monolithic
- 2-Tier
- N-Tier
- Modular Monolith
- MicroServices
- Event Driven
- Cloud-native
- ServerLess ETC

### 1. Monolithic

- user Interface
- Business logic
- Data interface
- Database

### Key Characteristics

- Single Codebase
- Centralized deployment
- shared database
- tight coupling

## Application Scalability

**Scaling is system design**

⇒ scaling in system design refers to the ability of a system to handle increased load or demand while maintaining or improving its performance.

**Performance vs scaling**

**performance**

- Low latency
- high throughput
  - concurrency
  - capacity
- capacity

**Scalability**

- subset of performance
- High throughput
- scale both up and down

### There are two types of scaling

- Vertical
- Horizontal

**Vertical Scaling**

⇒ vertical scaling also known as scaling up or scaling vertically refer to the process of increasing the capacity of a single server or recourse in order to handle a large load or improve performance.

**example ⇒ server starts 2 core 4GB then increases 16 core 64 GB**

**How do we achieve vertical scaling?**

- add more CPU
- add more memory
- increase storage capacity
- upgrade to a more powerful server

**Horizontal Scaling**
