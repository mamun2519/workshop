# Data Structures and Algorithm with Javascript

## Expand The DSA Full Form

DSA stands for Data structures & Algorithms. These are two different terms.

**Data Structures:**The storage where you can store data.

In **computer science**, a **data structure** is like those storage items — it’s a way of organizing and storing data so you can use it effectively.

Imagine you’re organizing your house. You have different storage items like:

- A drawer for socks
- A bookshelf for books
- A shoe rack for shoes
- A fridge for food
  Each of these helps you store and access things efficiently.

**Algorithms:** The procedures, the operations we need to work on the data.

In programming, an algorithm is a set of instructions to manipulate data and solve a problem.

Now, imagine you’re baking a cake. You follow a step-by-step recipe:

1. Get ingredients
2. Mix them
3. Bake for 30 minutes
4. Serve
   That recipe is an algorithm — a sequence of steps to solve a problem or accomplish a task. It requires data to process and these data is stored inside one or many data structures.

## Why Algorithm always comes with Data Structures

Data Structures without Algorithm is a sealed treasure that we can not open. Algorithm without having a data structure is just a set of instructions, we don’t need to worry about them. You almost never need one without the other.

### Common Data Structures

We are surrounded by data structures

List of Common Structures:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table / Hash Map
- Set
- Tree
- Heap
- Trie
- Graph

## Common Operations

Operation Meaning

- Insert => Add new data into the structure or memory
- Delete => Remove data from a specific location
- Update => Modify existing data
- Search/Find => Locate specific data based on a value or key
- Read/Access => Retrieve data from a location without modifying it
- Traverse => Visit all elements in a structured way (e.g., one by one, top to bottom)
- Sort => Rearrange data based on a rule (ascending, alphabetical, etc.)
- Transform => Convert data into another format/structure
- Merge => Combine two or more data collections into one
- Split => Divide a data collection into parts
- Map => Apply a function to every element (common in functional programming)
- Filter => Select elements based on a condition
- Aggregate => Compute a summary (sum, average, count, etc.)

## How to choose the correct data structure

Why do we need different data structures and algorithms?

Analogy: Untidy Expensive Room vs Tidy Cheap Room

We need to perform different operations to achieve different things. Some data structures are good at some operations while other data structures are good at some other operations. Based on the operations we need to decide which data structures will perform better. Sometimes, we need to use multiple data structures on same data for different operations.

But how can we know which data structures will perform better on which data structures? How do we measure? What is the metric?

The following two programs are doing the same thing, sorting an array. Between these two program which one will perform better?
