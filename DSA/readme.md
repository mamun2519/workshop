# Data Structures and Algorithm with Javascript

## Expand The DSA Full Form

DSA stands for Data structures & Algorithms. These are two different terms.

**Data Structures:**The storage where you can store data.

In **computer science**, a **data structure** is like those storage items — it’s a way of organizing and storing data so you can use it effectively.

Imagine you’re organizing your house. You have different storage items like:

- A drawer for socks
- A bookshelf for books
- A shoe rack for shoes
- A fridge for food
  Each of these helps you store and access things efficiently.

**Algorithms:** The procedures, the operations we need to work on the data.

In programming, an algorithm is a set of instructions to manipulate data and solve a problem.

Now, imagine you’re baking a cake. You follow a step-by-step recipe:

1. Get ingredients
2. Mix them
3. Bake for 30 minutes
   Serve
   That recipe is an algorithm — a sequence of steps to solve a problem or accomplish a task. It requires data to process and these data is stored inside one or many data structures.
