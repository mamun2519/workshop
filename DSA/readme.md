# Data Structures and Algorithm with Javascript

## Expand The DSA Full Form

DSA stands for Data structures & Algorithms. These are two different terms.

**Data Structures:**The storage where you can store data.

In **computer science**, a **data structure** is like those storage items — it’s a way of organizing and storing data so you can use it effectively.

Imagine you’re organizing your house. You have different storage items like:

- A drawer for socks
- A bookshelf for books
- A shoe rack for shoes
- A fridge for food
  Each of these helps you store and access things efficiently.

**Algorithms:** The procedures, the operations we need to work on the data.

In programming, an algorithm is a set of instructions to manipulate data and solve a problem.

Now, imagine you’re baking a cake. You follow a step-by-step recipe:

1. Get ingredients
2. Mix them
3. Bake for 30 minutes
4. Serve
   That recipe is an algorithm — a sequence of steps to solve a problem or accomplish a task. It requires data to process and these data is stored inside one or many data structures.

## Why Algorithm always comes with Data Structures

Data Structures without Algorithm is a sealed treasure that we can not open. Algorithm without having a data structure is just a set of instructions, we don’t need to worry about them. You almost never need one without the other.

### Common Data Structures

We are surrounded by data structures

List of Common Structures:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table / Hash Map
- Set
- Tree
- Heap
- Trie
- Graph

## Common Operations

Operation Meaning

- Insert => Add new data into the structure or memory
- Delete => Remove data from a specific location
- Update => Modify existing data
- Search/Find => Locate specific data based on a value or key
- Read/Access => Retrieve data from a location without modifying it
- Traverse => Visit all elements in a structured way (e.g., one by one, top to bottom)
- Sort => Rearrange data based on a rule (ascending, alphabetical, etc.)
- Transform => Convert data into another format/structure
- Merge => Combine two or more data collections into one
- Split => Divide a data collection into parts
  Map Apply a function to every element (common in functional programming)
  Filter Select elements based on a condition
  Aggregate Compute a summary (sum, average, count, etc.)
